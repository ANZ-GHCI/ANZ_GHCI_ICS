   About India Cancer Society (ICS)
Indian Cancer Society (http://www.indiancancersociety.org/)was established in 1951 by Dr. D.J. Jussawalla and Mr. Naval Tata as India's first voluntary, non-profit, National Organization for Awareness, Detection, Cure and Survivorship of those affected with this disease.
Indian Cancer Society has been doing sterling work in fighting cancer across India. It has been and continues to be the beacon of hope for thousands of underprivileged cancer patients


Current State
ICS presently doesn't have any automated setup for patient registration and screening in the medical camps.
Volunteers capture data manually in cancer detection camps.
Data entry is either on Excel or on printed paper.
Registration & Tracking of patient is  quite difficult.
Record handling is a challenge.

Future State
CSPR App will minimize and automate the task of registration and screening done at ICS camps
With the use of mobile and web application.
Volunteer/Doctor/ICS staff can use it with ease.
Record and track patients efficiently.
More user friendly and easy to use application
